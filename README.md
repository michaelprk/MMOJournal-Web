## üÜï Recent Development Progress

> Note for Shiny Hunts FK: After merging changes that include `app/db/sql/shiny_hunts_fk_cascade.sql`, run that SQL file in the Supabase SQL Editor to switch `parent_hunt_id` foreign key to `ON DELETE CASCADE` so deleting a parent hunt removes its phases.

## Damage Calculator (Standalone)

- Entry: visit `/calc` ‚Üí HTTP 302 redirect to the static calculator at `/pokemmo-damage-calc/index.html?gen=5`.
- No site chrome: the static page runs standalone (not wrapped by the app layout).
- Vendored build lives under `public/pokemmo-damage-calc/` (copied from `third_party/pokemmo-damage-calc/`).
- Theming: MMOJ visual tweaks in `public/pokemmo-damage-calc/mmoj-theme.css` (loaded after stock CSS). Additional runtime overrides and height sync exist in `public/pokemmo-damage-calc/theme/loader.js`.
- SEO: `/calc` loader sets `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` to discourage indexing.

Update workflow (vendored calc):
1) Update from upstream into `third_party/pokemmo-damage-calc/`.
2) Copy updated files into `public/pokemmo-damage-calc/` (preserve our `mmoj-theme.css` and `theme/loader.js`).
3) Do not modify upstream JS/HTML structure beyond linking our theme and removing the internal footer credits if desired.

Notes:
- Legacy `/damage-calc` in-app UI has been removed in favor of the standalone embed.
- All calculator logic remains upstream; our changes are CSS-only for branding and readability.
- Attribution: Engine/UI by upstream project `c4vv/pokemmo-damage-calc`.
