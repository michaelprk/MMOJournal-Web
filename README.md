Showdown import/export: Easily paste or export team builds compatible with Pokémon Showdown formats

Team grouping & smart suggestions: Organize builds into teams and get AI-driven team-building advice

Progress Journal with rich text: Allow players to blog their gameplay stories with media uploads and tagging

Community features: Comments, sharing public journals, and social interaction

Improved UX: Polished UI components, animations, and accessibility improvements

User settings & preferences: Theme options, notifications, and more personalized experience
