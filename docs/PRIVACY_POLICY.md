### MMOJournal â€“ Privacy Policy (Stub)

Last updated: 2025-08-14

- MMOJournal does not use non-essential cookies. We do not set analytics or advertising cookies.
- Essential storage: the app uses localStorage to keep you signed in and remember simple preferences (e.g., background options). This does not include tracking identifiers.
- Legacy calculator pages under `public/pokemmo-damage-calc` contain historical analytics snippets; these are disabled by our site security policy and do not run.
- For data access or deletion requests, see `docs/DSAR_RUNBOOK.md`.

### Data Retention

We store account data and user-generated content (e.g., PvP builds, shiny hunts) for as long as your MMOJournal account remains active. You may delete your account at any time from the settings page; this permanently deletes your content from our databases, subject to backup retention. Backups are kept for a limited period solely for disaster recovery and are automatically purged on rotation. We currently do not implement automatic deletion for inactive accounts; we may introduce a policy in the future and will update this notice accordingly.
