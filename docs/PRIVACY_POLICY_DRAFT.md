### MMOJournal – Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2025-08-14

This plain‑English draft explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and your choices. It is not legal advice and may be updated before launch.

### What we collect

- Account details: email, username, and a unique user ID.
- App content you add: competitive builds, shiny hunts (including notes/metadata), and similar journal entries.
- Technical basics: standard server logs and basic device information needed to run the service.
- Preferences: local settings stored in your browser (e.g., background/video preferences, UI flags).

We do not collect advertising identifiers, nor do we run analytics on the main app. Legacy calculator pages under `public/pokemmo-damage-calc` include historical analytics snippets; these are blocked by our site security policy and do not run.

### Why we collect it (legal basis)

- Provide the service: create an account, save your builds/hunts, and show your content back to you (contract).
- Keep the app reliable and secure: prevent abuse, troubleshoot issues (legitimate interests).
- Personalize the experience: remember non‑tracking preferences like background choice (legitimate interests).

We do not rely on consent for analytics or advertising, because we do not run them.

### How we use and share data

- We use your data to operate MMOJournal and the features you request.
- We share data with trusted sub‑processors that help us run the app:
  - Supabase (authentication, database, realtime)
  - Vercel (static hosting and delivery)
  These providers process data only to provide the service to us.

### Data Retention

We store account data and user-generated content (e.g., PvP builds, shiny hunts) for as long as your MMOJournal account remains active. You may delete your account at any time from the settings page; this permanently deletes your content from our databases, subject to backup retention. Backups are kept for a limited period solely for disaster recovery and are automatically purged on rotation. We currently do not implement automatic deletion for inactive accounts; we may introduce a policy in the future and will update this notice accordingly.

### Your rights

- Access and portability: download a copy of your data (Account → Download My Data).
- Correction: update your information in the app.
- Deletion: remove your builds/hunts/profile from MMOJournal (Account → Delete Account). You can also ask us to remove your login identity from our authentication system.
- Restriction and objection: contact us if you have questions or concerns.

### Children

MMOJournal is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country). Do not use the service if you are under the minimum age.
