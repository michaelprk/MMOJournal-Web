### MMOJournal – Cookies & Local Storage (Draft)

Last updated: 2025-08-14

### Do we use non‑essential cookies?

No. MMOJournal does not use analytics, advertising, or other non‑essential cookies.

### What storage do we use?

- We use the browser’s localStorage for essential app settings such as background/video preferences and UI flags. This storage is scoped to your browser and is not used for tracking.

### Consent

- Because we do not use non‑essential cookies or analytics, no consent banner is shown.

### How to revoke or clear storage

- You can clear MMOJournal data via your browser’s site settings (clear local storage and cached data for the site), or use in‑app delete features to remove your account data from our database.

### Legacy calculator pages

- Static calculator pages under `public/pokemmo-damage-calc` include historical analytics snippets. Our site security policy blocks these from running.
